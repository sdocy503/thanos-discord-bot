# thanos-discord-bot
A bot for discord that will ban half the users in your server at the snap of your fingers.
How to use:
1. Open project in visual studio.
2. Go into the program.cs file and change the bot token there to the token of the bot you made.
3. Press Control + F5 to run the bot.
4. Let if connect
5. As long as the bot is in the server you want to snap you should be able to just use the command !snap and it will do the deed.

If you have any questions feel free to ask but I reccomend googling your problem first as it probably can answer your question faster.
